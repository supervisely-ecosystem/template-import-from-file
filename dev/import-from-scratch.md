# Create import app from scratch (without export template from SDK)

## Introduction

We recommend to use SDK import template for creating custom import app using class `sly.app.Import`.
However, if your use case is not covered by our import template, you can create your own app **from scratch**  without the template using basic methods from Supervisely SDK.

We will go through the following steps:

[**Step 1.**](#step-1-how-to-debug-import-app) How to debug import app.

[**Step 2**](#step-2-how-to-write-an-import-script) How to write an import script.

[**Step 3.**](#step-3-advanced-debug) Advanced debug.

[**Step 4.**](#step-4-how-to-run-it-in-supervisely) How to run it in Supervisely.

Everything you need to reproduce [this tutorial is on GitHub](): source code and additional app files.

Before we begin, please clone the project and set up the working environment - [here is a link with a description of the steps](./overview.md#set-up-an-environment-for-development).

## Step 1. How to debug import app

Open `local.env` and set up environment variables by inserting your values here for debugging. Learn more about environment variables in our [guide](../../getting-started/environment-variables.md)

```python
TASK_ID=33572                 # ⬅️ requires to use advanced debugging, comment for local debugging
TEAM_ID=8                     # ⬅️ change it to your team ID
WORKSPACE_ID=349              # ⬅️ change it to your workspace ID
PROJECT_ID=18334              # ⬅️ ID of the project where your data will be imported (optional)
DATASET_ID=66325              # ⬅️ ID of the dataset where your data will be imported (optional)
SLY_APP_DATA_DIR="results/"   # ⬅️ path to directory for advanced debug (your data will be downloaded in this directory)
```

## Step 2. How to write an import script

See the description of this example [here](./create-export-app-from-template.md#step-2-overview-of-the-simple-illustrative-example-we-will-use-in-tutorial)

Find source code for this example [here](https://github.com/supervisely-ecosystem/export-custom-format/blob/master/src/main.py)

**Step 1. Import libraries**

```python
import os

import supervisely as sly
from supervisely.sly_logger import logger
from dotenv import load_dotenv
from tqdm import tqdm
```

**Step 2. Load environment variables**

Load ENV variables for debug, has no effect in production

```python
load_dotenv("local.env")
load_dotenv(os.path.expanduser("~/supervisely.env"))
```

**Step 3. Init app object and api object to communicate with Supervisely Server**

```python
api = sly.Api.from_env()
app = sly.Application()
```

**Step 4. Get environment variables**

```python
TASK_ID = sly.env.task_id(raise_not_found=False)
TEAM_ID = sly.env.team_id()
WORKSPACE_ID = sly.env.workspace_id()
PROJECT_ID = sly.env.project_id(raise_not_found=False)
DATASET_ID = sly.env.dataset_id(raise_not_found=False)
PATH_TO_FOLDER = sly.env.folder()
REMOVE_SOURCE_FILES = sly.env.remove_source_files()
IS_PRODUCTION = sly.is_production()
STORAGE_DIR = sly.app.get_data_dir()
```

**Step 6. Get or create destination project and dataset**

```python
if PROJECT_ID is None:
    project = api.project.create(
        workspace_id=WORKSPACE_ID, name="My Project", change_name_if_conflict=True
    )
else:
    project = api.project.get_info_by_id(PROJECT_ID)
if DATASET_ID is None:
    dataset = api.dataset.create(project_id=project.id, name="ds0", change_name_if_conflict=True)
else:
    dataset = api.dataset.get_info_by_id(DATASET_ID)
```

**Step 7. Get directory with data**

```python
# download folder from Supervisely Team Files to local storage if debugging in production mode
if IS_PRODUCTION is True:
    # specify local path to download
    local_folder_path = os.path.join(STORAGE_DIR, os.path.basename(PATH_TO_FOLDER))
    # download file from Supervisely Team Files to local storage
    api.file.download_directory(
        team_id=TEAM_ID, remote_path=PATH_TO_FOLDER, local_save_path=local_folder_path
    )
else:
    local_folder_path = PATH_TO_FOLDER
```

**Step 8. Iterate over files in directory to get images names and paths**

```python
images_names = []
images_paths = []
for file in os.listdir(local_folder_path):
    file_path = os.path.join(local_folder_path, file)
    images_names.append(file)
    images_paths.append(file_path)
```

**Step 9. Iterate over images names and paths and upload them to Supervisely**

```python
# process images and upload them by paths
with tqdm(total=len(images_paths)) as pbar:
    for img_name, img_path in zip(images_names, images_paths):
        try:
            # upload image into dataset on Supervisely server
            info = api.image.upload_path(dataset_id=dataset.id, name=img_name, path=img_path)
            sly.logger.trace(f"Image has been uploaded: id={info.id}, name={info.name}")
        except Exception as e:
            sly.logger.warn("Skip image", extra={"name": img_name, "reason": repr(e)})
        finally:
            # update progress bar
            pbar.update(1)

# remove local storage directory with files after uploading
sly.fs.remove_dir(STORAGE_DIR)
```

**Step 10. Set output project and clean source files (optional)**

```python
if IS_PRODUCTION is True:
    info = api.project.get_info_by_id(project.id)
    api.task.set_output_project(task_id=TASK_ID, project_id=info.id, project_name=info.name)
    # remove source files from Supervisely Team Files after successful import
    if REMOVE_SOURCE_FILES is True:
        api.file.remove(team_id=TEAM_ID, path=PATH_TO_FOLDER)
        sly.fs.remove_dir(PATH_TO_FOLDER)
        logger.info(msg=f"Source directory: '{PATH_TO_FOLDER}' was successfully removed.")
    logger.info(f"Result project: id={info.id}, name={info.name}")
```

**Step 11. Shutdown application after import**

```python
app.shutdown()
```

## Step 3. Advanced debug

In addition to the regular debug option, this template also includes setting for `Advanced debugging`.

![launch.json](https://github.com/supervisely/developer-portal/assets/79905215/59a8d123-22bb-45bc-87a5-92cb52f191f9)

The advanced debugging option is somewhat identical, however it will upload result archive or folder with data to `Team Files` instead (Path to result archive - `/tmp/supervisely/export/Supervisely App/<SESSION ID>/<PROJECT_ID>_<PROJECT_NAME>.tar`).
This option is an example of how production apps work in Supervisely platform.

Output of this python program:

```text

```

## Step 4. How to run it in Supervisely

Submitting an app to the Supervisely Ecosystem isn’t as simple as pushing code to github repository, but it’s not as complicated as you may think of it either.

Please follow this [link](../basics/add-private-app.md) for instructions on adding your app. We have produced a step-by-step guide on how to add your application to the Supervisely Ecosystem.
